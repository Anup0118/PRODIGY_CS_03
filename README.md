This repository contains a Python script for assessing the complexity of a password. The script checks various criteria to determine the strength of the password and provides feedback on how to improve it if necessary.

How It Works:

 1. Length Check: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
  
 2. Uppercase Letter Check: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
  
 3. Lowercase Letter Check: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
  
 4. Digit Check: The password must contain at least one digit.
  
 5. Special Character Check: The password must contain at least one special character (non-alphanumeric).
